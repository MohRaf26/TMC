tmc - Command-line client for TestMyCode

SYNOPSIS

`tmc` [`-h|--help`] [`-v|--version`]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`tmc` is an exercise testing and submission utility for students participating
on online courses utilising the free and open TestMyCode-framework. TMC-CLI is
a command-line interface for TMC-CORE, the TestMyCode client backend. TMC-CLI's
primary features include downloading exercises, running tests, viewing progress
and submitting completed exercises.

All functionality is divided between different commands. To use `tmc` for any
meaningful task, you must issue a command after `tmc`. Commands each have their own
options. For more information on commands and their options, see the `COMMAND`
sections below.

FILES
-----

`[course directory]/.tmc.json`
  Course configuration and cache file. Saves the status of the username, server
  address and course's exercises. Manually editing this file may have adverse
  effects.

`~/.config/tmc-cli/properties.json`
  User configuration file. Use `tmc prop` to edit properties.

`~/.config/tmc-cli/accounts.json`
  User login credentials. Use `tmc logout` to safely delete.

`~/.config/tmc-cli/logs/tmc-cli.log`
  Debug logging.

For more on config locations, see `ENVIRONMENT` -> `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `APPDATA`.

ENVIRONMENT

`EDITOR`
  Text editor for editing messages for pastebin and feedback. If unset, defaults
  to `nano` on Unix and `notepad` on Windows.

`PAGER`
  Pager for displaying text files. If unset, defaults to `less -R` on Unix.
  This functionality is broken on Windows, but defaults to `more`.

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
  If set on Unix, *~/.config/* in config file paths is replaced with its value.

`APPDATA`
  On Windows, *~/.config/* is replaced with the value of `%APPDATA%`, usually
  *C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\.* If `%APPDATA%` is unset, user's home
  directory will be used instead.
