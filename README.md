#tmc-cli

TMC-CLI is the command-line client for University of Helsinki's Test My Code -framework. Test My Code is used by various online programming courses for exercise testing and submission.

##Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment 7
* Linux, Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows
  * Currently only limited support for Windows
  * Other Unix-like systems may work, but are not tested
* If you want autocompletion, Bash or a Bash-compatible shell is required

##Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/tmc-cli/tmc-cli/releases/latest).
If you use Linux or OS X, choose "tmc". If you use Windows, choose "tmc-cli-[VERSION].jar".

If you downloaded "tmc", navigate to the download directory on your terminal and make it executable with `chmod u+x ./tmc`.

Launch tmc once with `./tmc`. Running tmc-cli for the first time will add an alias to your .bashrc, enabling you to use tmc-cli by invoking the command `tmc`. For the alias to come into effect, execute `. ~/.bashrc` or simply open a new terminal.

To summarise:
```
~ $ chmod u+x tmc
~ $ ./tmc
~ $ . ~/.bashrc
~ $ echo "Now you can run tmc anywhere."
```

If for some reason the alias was not added to your .bashrc or your shell of choice is not Bash, you can manually add the following line `alias tmc="[PATH_TO_TMC]"` to your .bashrc / other shell rc file.

If you are using Windows and you downloaded the .jar file, you must use tmc-cli directly with Java like so: `java -jar [path_to_tmc-cli.jar]`. In the following examples, replace `tmc` with this command. (note: you must have set Java on your system `%PATH%`. For more information, see [this Java help page](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).)

Now that you've installed tmc-cli, you can view all available commands by running tmc without arguments or with `tmc --help`. You can also view all available options for commands by running them with the `--help` switch, for example `tmc courses --help`.

##Logging in

Once installation is complete, you can log in using `tmc login`. This saves your TMC login information to a configuration file in ~/.config/tmc-cli/ (or %LOCALAPPDATA% on Windows) - you will only have to log in once.
```
~ $ tmc login
server address:
username:
password:
Login successful.
```

##Listing courses

Once you have logged in, you can list all the available courses on the server with `tmc courses`.
```
~ $ tmc courses
java-programming-basics
java-programming-advanced
algorithms-101
c-mooc
javascript-for-lazy-hipsters
```
Note that you can only submit exercises on courses for which you have enrolled.

##Downloading courses

Navigate to a suitable directory in which you wish to download your course(s). Then, run `tmc download [COURSE_NAME]`. This will create a new directory for your course and download all available exercises into it.

```
~ $ mkdir tmc-courses; cd tmc-courses
~/tmc-courses $ tmc download test-course
Downloading: test-course
[exercise1, exercise2, exercise3, exercise4]
~/tmc-courses $ cd test-course
~/tmc-courses/test-course $ ls -pa
exercise1/  exercise2/  exercise3/  exercise4/  .tmc.json
```
Course-specific information is stored in .tmc.json. Do not manually edit or remove it unless you are completely done with the course - doing so will cause tmc to not function properly.

##Running tests

After you've completed an exercise and wish to run tests on it, navigate to the exercise directory and run `tmc test`. If you are in the course root directory, you can also give the names of the exercises as arguments: `tmc test exercise1 exercise2`. Running `tmc test` in the course root with no arguments will run tests on all exercises.

```
~/tmc-courses/test-course/exercise1 $ tmc test
Testing: exercise1
Test results: 1/1 tests passed
All tests passed! Submit to server with 'tmc submit'
```

##Submitting exercises

You have now completed your first exercise! To submit your exercise, run `tmc submit`. The syntax is the same as for running tests.

```
~/tmc-courses/test-course/exercise1 $ tmc submit
Submitting: exercise1
Test results: 1/1 tests passed
All tests passed on server!
Points permanently awarded: [exercise1]
Model solution: https://link.to.model/solution
```

##Updating the course

As you complete exercises, more exercises may become available. To update the course and download new exercises, run `tmc update`.

```
~/tmc-courses/test-course $ tmc update
New exercises downloaded: [exercise5, exercise6]
```

##Listing exercises

If you want to see your current progress, you can view the status of all course exercises with `tmc exercises [course]`. By default, the exercise list is viewed in your system's pager, but you can print them directly to your terminal with the `-n` or `--no-pager` switch.

```
~/tmc-courses/test-course $ tmc exercises test-course -n
Course name: test-course
Deadline: 2038-20-01 at 18:00:00
  Completed: exercise1
  Completed: exercise2
  Attempted: exercise3
  Not completed: exercise4
```

##Sending exercises to pastebin

If you're having trouble with an exercise or just want to have your code peer-reviewed, you can use `tmc paste` to send an exercise to the TMC server's pastebin. You'll be prompted to add a message, but it is optional.

```
~/tmc-courses/test-course/exercise1 $ tmc paste
Zipping project
Submitting project
Paste sent for exercise exercise1
Model solution: https://link.to.paste/bin
```

You cannot submit exercises that you have completed.
